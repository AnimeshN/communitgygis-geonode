As a platform it is for people who range from those who can contribute data ( mobile based point data collection to digitization of published maps) to those who can analyse the data to infer useful social knowledge. It is a digital contraption needed to collect, aggregate , access and analyse data finally provide decision support for to manipulate reality.
